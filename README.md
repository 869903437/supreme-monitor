## Upcoming Supreme Monitor - Coming soon

I already finished this supreme monitor long time ago, haven't really used it much. So thats why I am going to open source it.
Give me like couple more days, so I can push a quick update, clean up the messy code and yeah! I have plans to create a discord server so I can host all my opensource monitor there.

## Features

- Restock Monitor
- Proxy Support
- Newly Added Item (coming soon)
- Database Configuration
- Quick Task Integrated (Implemented majority of the bot quick task)
- Custom Discord Embed (You can change to your group if you want)
- US / EU / JP - SUPPORTED

## Quick Note

- I never tried EU or JP, but I believe it will work so yeah.
- No, I did not use the endpoint, because I feel that the front end store is much faster than loading thru backend.
  - If you want a endpoint verison that just message me on twitter.
- I would recommend using proxies because you will get temp ban or ban from supreme during drop day.
  - You are able to use ip auth or user pass proxies
- I added comments so people can use this for monitor references
